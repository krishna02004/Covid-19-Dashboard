**COVID-19 Data Analytics Dashboard**
This portfolio project replicates Alex The Analyst’s "Data Analyst Portfolio Project" series (parts 1 and 2). It creates a full data analytics pipeline—from data exploration in SQL to data visualization in Tableau—analyzing global COVID-19 data to identify key trends in cases, deaths, and vaccinations.

**Project Overview**
Part 1: SQL Data Exploration
Imported and cleaned global COVID-19 datasets.
Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to find trends in infection rates, death percentages, and vaccination progress across different countries and continents.
Prepared the data for visualization by creating specific views.

**Part 2: Tableau Visualization**
Imported the SQL query outputs into Tableau.
Designed an interactive dashboard to visualize the insights found during the exploration phase.
Implemented forecasting to project future infection trends.

**Skills & Tools Used**

SQL (Server Management Studio):

Joins, CTEs (Common Table Expressions), Temp Tables
Windows Functions (e.g., Rolling Counts)
Aggregate Functions (SUM, MAX, AVG)
Creating Views for data storage
Data Type Conversion

Tableau Public:

Dashboard Creation and Formatting
Calculated Fields
Interactive Maps and Bar Charts
Forecasting/Predictive Analysis

Visualizations
The final dashboard includes:

Global Stats: Total cases, deaths, and overall death percentage.
Death Count by Continent: A bar chart breaking down mortality by region.
Infection Map: A geographic heat map showing the percentage of the population infected by country.
Infection Forecast: A time-series analysis predicting future infection rates.
